## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn behavior in a telecom dataset to identify key drivers of churn and provide insights for customer retention strategies.  
The analysis focuses on demographic factors, service subscriptions, contract types, tenure, and billing patterns.  

The project includes data cleaning, transformation, correlation analysis, and interactive dashboards built in Power BI.
